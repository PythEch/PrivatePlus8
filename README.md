inpornito7
==========

inpornito7 provides a better private mode for the iOS 7 Safari.
you can soon find it on cydia as PrivatePlus7.

It lets you set wildcarded blacklist filters, automatically enables private mode in that tab when a tab goes in a website that's address matches a filter in the blacklist.

This is especially useful when you often forget to go to private mode or to clear your history. ;^)

**inpornito7 is mostly complete. there will be no continued development. expect an inpornito8 in 2015.**

**also we'd be happy to merge if anyone out there cares to make pull requests**

to enable the tweak or set blacklists doubletap the private mode button on safari, that'll launch the inpornito menu.

on the same menu you can also remove all filters on the blacklist, or when you are browsing a blacklisted website, remove that blacklist filter.
